# Setup

## Assigning a Domain Name
Run
``` bash
echo "<ip> <preferred host name>" >> /etc/hosts
```
You can navigate easily through your preferred host name thereafter rather than remembering the IP.

``` bash
# Example
echo "10.10.43.11 ghost.thm" >> /etc/hosts
```

## Assigning to Variable ```$IP```
Alternatively, you can also use the below command but it only work on your current terminal and will have to resetup every time u open a new terminal.
``` bash
export IP=<ip>
```
With the above command, now ```$IP``` will be the ip address you store.

``` bash
# Example
export IP="10.10.111.12"
```
